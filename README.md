# Simple Spelling Corrector with Python
This is a fun little Python program that helps correct common spelling mistakes! It's a great example of how computers can understand and fix text.

# What it Does
This program takes a list of words that might be misspelled and tries to figure out their correct spellings. It then prints out the original "wrong" words and their "corrected" versions.

# How it Works (A Simple Look)
Imagine you have a super smart dictionary (way bigger than a normal one!) and a helpful assistant.

You give it a word: You hand the assistant a word you think might be spelled wrong (like "Mahine learnin").

The assistant checks: The assistant (which is the TextBlob library in our program) looks up that word in its huge smart dictionary.

It finds the closest match: It tries its best to find the word that's most similar and correctly spelled.

It tells you the right word: The assistant then tells you what it thinks the correct spelling is.

Our program does this for each word in a list you give it, one by one!
